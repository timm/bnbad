## Overview

Is your software ethical?  Does its own source code  holds a
representation of user goals and  uses those at runtime to guide
its own behavior?  Can that software report how well the user goals
are being achieved and can it suggest how to adjust the system, to
better achieve those goals?

Do you want to make your software more ethical?  BnBAD is a
collection of data structures that support ethical the kind of
ethical reasoning listed above.  It is a multi-objective optimizer
that reasons by breaking up problems into regions of `bad` and
`better`, then looks for ways on how to jump between those regions.

BnBAD might be an ethical choice in domains:

- when users have to trade-off competing goals, 
- when succinct explanations are needed about what the system is doing,
- when  those explanations have to include ranges within which it is safe
  to change the system, 
- when guidance is needed for how to improve things
  (or know what might make things worse); 
- when thing being studied is constantly changing so:
   - we have to perpetually check if the current system is still trustworthy
   - and, if not, we need to update our models

Technical notes: 

- `bad` and `better` are score via 
  [Zitler&#39;s continuous domination predicate](#bnbad.Tab.better)
- Examples are clustered in goal
  space and the `better` cluster is the one that dominates all the
  other `bad` clusters.
- Numerics are then broken up into just a few ranges
  using a bottom-up merging process
  guided by the ratio of `better` to `bad`  in each range. 
- These numeric ranges,
  and the symbolic ranges are then used to build a succinct decision list
  that can explain what constitutes `better` behavior. 
  This decision list has many uses:
    - _Planning_: The deltas in the conditions that lead to the leaves of that decision list can
      offer guidance on how to change
      `bad` to `better`. 
    - _Monitoring_: The opposite of planning. Learn what can change `better`
      to `bad`, then watch out for those things.
    - _Anomaly detection and incremental certification:_ 
     The current decision list can be trusted as long as new examples 
     fall close to the old examples seen in the leaves of the decision list.
    - _Stream mining_: Stop learning while the anomaly detector is not
      triggering. Track the anomalies seen each branch of the decision list.
      Update just the branches that get too many anomalies (if that ever happens).

## Classes

In my code `Thing` and `o` are basic utility classes. `Thing`s
know how to pretty-print themselves while `o` classes are
basic containers for things with names slots (but no methods).

     Thing
        o  
        Cluster
           Bore       :has 1 :to 2 :of Tab
           Tree       :has 1 :to * :of Tab
        Col(txt,pos)
           Num(mu,lo,hi)
           Sym(mode)
        Cols          :has 1 :to * :of Col
        Dist          :has 1 :to 1 :of Tab
        Range(lo,hi)
        Ranges        :has 1 :to * :of Range
        Tab(rows)     :has 1 :to 1 :of Cols  
        Test

The real work here is done by `Tab`les. 
Such `Tab`les are the core of this design.
When data is read from disk
it is entered into a `Tab`le. When collecting data from some
process, that data is incrementally written into a `Tab`le.
If we recursively cluster data, each level of that recursion

into tables. that have `rows` and `cols`.
Each row is some example of `y=f(x)` where `y` and `x`
can have multiple values (and when `|y|&gt;1`, then this
then becomes a multi-objective reasoner).

Our  `rows` are just plain old Python lists. We can
compute the `dist`ance between rows as well as checking
if the goals in one row are &#34;better than&#34; (also known as
&#34;dominates&#34;) the other.

`Col` objects summarize what was seen in each column. There are
two general kinds of `Col`s (`Num`erics and `Sym`bols) and
which can be categoriesed into

- `y` values:
 - numeric goals (that we might want to maximize or minimze)
 - symbolic gaols (that are also called `klass`es)
- `x` values:
 - which can be numeric or symbolic.

   When working on `auto93`, the goals are

  then this finds a `best` cluster of

       {2492.5, 19.7, 34.1}

  A random sample of the remaining data is then
  collected into `rest` which has median goal
  scores of:

      {3012.2, 15.2, 22.9}

  Then we run a rule learner that generates a decision

def test_tree():
  &#34;&#34;&#34;\
  Recursively divide the data in two.

  When working on `auto93`, the goals are
  
      [&#39;&lt;weight&#39;, &#39;&gt;acceleration&#39;, &#39;&gt;!mpg&#39;]

  which to say, minimize `weight`, maximize `acceleration` and
  `mpg`.  If you call this after setting `my.treeVerbose=True` then
  this tree will get printed. Note the leaf four lines from the
  bottom, marked with &#34;`*`&#34;.  This is cluster is &#34;best&#34; (least
  `weight`, most `acceleration`, most `mph`).
